## Projects Undertaken

### 1) Cell Phone Based Distant Object Control

#### Platform: Circuit Board

In this project, a remote [land
rover](/assets/img/13032009263.jpg) was controlled using
**DTMF tones** from a cellular device. Unlike the traditional remote control
which has a limited range, a cell phone covers the entire Earth. The video
camera on the cell phone could also be used to transmit live feed back.

This project won **first prize** in the National Symposium "COMPSEM-09"
organized by Annamalai University in year 2009.

### 2) Visual Speech Synthesis

#### Platform: Visual C++

In this project, a software was implemented to convert an
input text into an audiovisual speech stream and play it **incorporating the
head and eye movements** of a human being in real-time. Instead of relying on
existing speech engines(like Festival), a new engine is created which
**resolves ambiguities** in English language properly and has an **Indian
accent**.

### 3) IPwatch

#### Platform: C

[IPwatch](https://github.com/samueljohnson/IPwatch/blob/master/ipwatch.c) maintains a database (sqlite3) of IP address that are assigned to MAC addresses and informs sysadmins (and optionally users) of any misuse of IP in a network.

### 4) Steganography Removal

#### Platform: C

The project deals with creation of a tool which removes steganographic content
from a file. The idea is to implement the tool in corporate environment's mail server,
where every outgoing e-mail is first sent to this tool.

## Work Experience

### Physical Research Laboratory, July 2012 - Current

#### Designation : Scientist / Engineer - SC

  * Deployed KVM based hypervisor and migrated physical servers to virtual machines.
  * Enforced campus wide SMTP and IMAP SSL encryption.
  * Enforced campus wide SMTP Authentication.
  * Implemented VPN access for Linux users.
  * Deployed new mail system based on Horde framework and successfully migrated existing user data from squirrelmail.
  * Coded and implemented a tool from scratch to inform sysadmins (and users) of misuse of IP in a network.
  * Deployed two ISPs in load balancing *and* fail-safe mode so as to have a complete
utilization of both networks and at the same time have redundancy in case one of the ISP is down.
