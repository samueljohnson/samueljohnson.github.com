## Projects Undertaken

### 1) Cell Phone Based Distant Object Control

In this project, a remote [land
rover](/assets/img/13032009263.jpg) was controlled using
**DTMF tones** from a cellular device. Unlike the traditional remote control
which has a limited range, a cell phone covers the entire Earth. The video
camera on the cell phone could also be used to transmit live feed back.

This project fetched **first prize** in the National Symposium "COMPSEM-09"
organized by Annamalai University in year 2009.

### 2) Visual Speech Synthesis

In this project, a Visual C++ based software was implemented to convert an
input text into an audiovisual speech stream and play it **incorporating the
head and eye movements** of a human being in real-time. Instead of relying on
existing speech engines(like Festival), a new engine is created which
**resolves ambiguities** in English language properly and has an **Indian
accent**.

### 3) Steganography Removal

The project deals with creation of a tool which removes steganographic content
from a file. The idea is to implement the
[tool](https://github.com/samueljohnson/stegr/blob/master/stegr.c) in
corporate environment's mail server, where every outgoing e-mail is first sent
to this tool.
